"""Score your work for Assignment 3 against the PUBLIC tests, grader-style.

This runs exactly the checks the autograder runs, but only against the public
fixture that ships with this assignment -- the one whose inputs and expected
outputs you can inspect yourself (see ``tests/expected/``). It prints a mark
sheet so you can see where you stand before submitting.

Your submitted mark is 30% this public suite and 70% a private suite that calls
the same functions with *different* inputs. Solve the problem in general;
matching these particular numbers is not enough.

Usage:
    python check_my_work.py                  # full mark sheet
    python check_my_work.py --only AABBTree
    python check_my_work.py --verbose        # full failure messages
